# Capacitive Touch Sensor Using LM358

## Goal of the project

The goal of the project was to demonstrate and build a fully functional touch sensor using a high impedance sensing node.

## Components

LM358 op amp,
1.5 MΩ and 100 kΩ voltage divider,
1 MΩ pull down resistor,
Coin touch plate,
White LED,
150 Ω current limiting resistor,
Jumper wires,
5 V supply

## Circuit

This section includes the full circuit used for the touch sensor.
It shows the LM358 configured as a comparator, the high impedance sensing node, the reference voltage divider, the pull down resistor, and the LED output stage.

## How it works

When the user touches the pad, their body adds a small capacitance and leakage path that slightly raises the voltage at the sensing node.

The LM358 compares this voltage to a fixed reference voltage generated by the 1.5 MΩ and 100 kΩ divider. In this project the reference was about 0.31 V.

If the sensed voltage exceeds the threshold, the comparator output of the LM358 goes high and drives the LED.

The high impedance on the input ensures the circuit only reacts to actual touches and ignores noise.

## Debugging and iteration

Started with a transistor based design. The LED output was dim and unreliable.

Switched to the LM358 comparator.

The first LM358 attempt was unstable and picked up too much noise. This was fixed by adjusting the reference voltage.

Started with a 7 MΩ pull down resistor. It was too sensitive and triggered without touching the plate. Settled on 1 MΩ for stable detection.

Verified low current consumption. The circuit only draws current when the coin is touched.

## Future improvements
1) Add a Schmitt trigger stage to make the threshold cleaner
2) Build a PCB version for a more compact and stable design.

## Actual circuit build 
This is the final working implementation of the touch sensor on a breadboard.
