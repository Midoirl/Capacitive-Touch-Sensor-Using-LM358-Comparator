# Capacitive-Touch-Sensor-Using-LM358-Comparator
This project demonstrates a simple but effective touch sensor build using a high-impedance sensing node, a voltage divider refrence and an LM358 op-amp configured as a comparator. Touching the metal pad introduces a small capacitance and leakage path that shifts the node boltage just enough for the comparator to detect.
